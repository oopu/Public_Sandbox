					<p>O hi, you have found my webpage. I've placed here a few different things which I hope you'll find interesting.</p>
					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>Youâ€™re looking at the page of a front-end developer that constantly stretches beyond the typical bounds of the role. When you hire me, you get not only a highly talented software engineer, but someone with great design skills, strong people skills, management and startup experience. I have always found ways to accomplish more than the tasks at hand, and I will flourish in a role that has room for such growth.</p>
					<p>I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2010 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a minor in Studio Art, concentrating in video game development and digital art, respectively. I immediately became a co-founder of Red Seraphim, a social-gaming startup that was trying to make the field more interesting by giving people a cross-platform game that had more depth than most games available. Despite joining on as a Flash developer, I quickly was given the responsibility to not only lead development efforts of our Flash client, but to act as Senior Producer for the efforts of the company as a whole. At our height I had 8 direct reports, was mentoring some of the more junior developers in the finer points of object-oriented design and software engineering, and helping guide the CEO's thoughts on the design and direction in which he was taking the project. It was a massive undertaking, a difficult two years, and the most thrilling experience of my professional career so far. It was an excellent opportunity for me to apply my versatility.</p>
					<p>In my time since, I've been working as the primary developer in the E-Learning team in FireEye, teaching people about malware threats and how to get our products ready to defend your network. I have enjoyed the new challenges brought forth when instruction becomes the goal of the project as opposed to the first moments that tend to be inserted as an afterthought in many web apps. It is also cool to be able to work with industry thought-leaders and create better products than have been ever seen before in training, and with the bar set this high I am consistently pushing each of my skills to the edge. The rapid growth of the company has brought many challenges, but my natural inclination for good software design has enabled rapid development with consistent deliveries, and I'm always striving to improve workflow even further.</p>
					<p>Anyway, that's the overview. If you want to see some more of the stuff I've done, check out the links on this page. I also am a fan of human interaction, so if you would like to get in touch, <a href="mailto:nowucblanco@gmail.com">contact me via email</a> or check out my LinkedIn page and leave me a message there.</p>
